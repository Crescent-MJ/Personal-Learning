The Enigma cipher was a cryptographic machine used during World War II for secure communication 
by the German military. It was developed in the 1920s and 1930s and was primarily designed to encrypt and decrypt messages.

The Enigma machine consisted of a series of rotors, an entry wheel, a reflector, and a keyboard. Each rotor had 26 contacts 
representing the letters of the alphabet. When a key on the keyboard was pressed, an electrical signal was passed through 
the rotors, creating an encryption pathway. The signal would enter a rotor, pass through a series of contacts, reflect off 
the reflector, and then return through the rotors in a different pathway to illuminate a lamp indicating the encrypted letter.

The key aspect of the Enigma machine was its ability to scramble the electrical pathway through the rotors with each key press. 
The rotors would rotate after each key press, altering the electrical connections and changing the encryption pattern. 
This made the cipher more complex and harder to break.

To decrypt a message encrypted with the Enigma machine, the recipient would need to have an Enigma machine set up with 
the same rotor settings and starting positions as the sender. By typing the encrypted message on the keyboard, the recipient 
would observe the decrypted message on the illuminated lamps.

During World War II, breaking the Enigma cipher was a significant challenge for the Allies. However, through the efforts of codebreakers, 
including notable figures like Alan Turing at Bletchley Park, the British were able to decipher Enigma-encrypted messages. 
The success in breaking the Enigma code played a crucial role in intelligence gathering and ultimately contributed to the Allied victory.

The Enigma cipher is considered a historically significant encryption machine and an important milestone in the development of cryptography. 
It demonstrated the need for stronger encryption methods and paved the way for subsequent cryptographic advancements.
